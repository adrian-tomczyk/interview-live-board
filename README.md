# Decisions
- At first, I created a solution that was a bit complicated. What I wanted to achieve is a solution which will be really easy to maintain, extend later on and provide potentially faster sorting algorithm for this case. But since the task description says "Keep it simple", I decided to abandon the solution I had before.
- LiveFootballWorldCupScoreBoardTest class exists as a kind of Facade. Before it had more functionality. I left it as is, because it provides a readable result of changing scoreboard. I didn't want to put displaying logic into LiveMatches class.
- Double spaces between functions separates them visually (that's my preference)
- In my primary solution I decided to separate updateScore into two functions - it significantly reduces problems with updating score. I could easily add event that could deduce points in such case.
